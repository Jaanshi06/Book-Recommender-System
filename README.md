📚 Book Recommender System<br>

A machine learning–based book recommendation engine that suggests books using Popularity-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering with Cosine Similarity.
It helps users discover books tailored to their interests while handling the cold start problem through popularity-based recommendations.<br>

🔍 Overview<br>

This system implements two main recommendation approaches:<br>

Popularity-Based Filtering – Recommends books that are most popular among readers, based on ratings and number of reviews.<br>

Collaborative Filtering – Suggests books by finding similarities between users’ reading preferences, using cosine similarity to compute closeness in feature space.<br>
